Hello, I’m Jayesh Yadav, a passionate software developer with a strong foundation in full-stack development. Currently, I’m pursuing CSE from KPGU Vadodara. I thrive in environments where I can continuously learn and solve complex problems with creativity and precision.



I’ve worked on several projects that showcase my expertise , including

[PureCart – MERN Stack, Health & Budget Platform].

A platform designed to help health-conscious, budget-savvy shoppers.



I also built [“Chat with Data” – AI-powered document processing (Langchain, LLM, Next.js)] for efficient interaction  with structured and unstructured data.



At [thebundled.ai – AI Image Generation, Model Integration (Intern)], I am currently an intern, gaining hands-on experience integrating multiple image generation models into a single platform..



I’ve participated in various hackathons, winning

[1st prize at MLH ChatHacks]

and [Best Use of Vonage at HackthisFall].



I’m excited to take on new challenges, collaborate with passionate professionals, and make an impact in the tech world.
